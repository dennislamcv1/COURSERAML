    "In this lab, you'll learn how to transform categorical data into numerical form - a crucial step in preparing data for machine learning models. You'll work with a dataset containing information about individuals' salaries, education levels, and occupations. By applying appropriate encoding techniques to these categorical variables, you'll prepare the data for a salary prediction model while maintaining the underlying relationships within the data.\n",

    "- Identify which categorical variables need transformation and select appropriate encoding techniques\n",

    "- Implement One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical variables using scikit-learn\n",

    "## üîç Common Issues & Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** One-Hot Encoding creates too many columns when there are many unique categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Consider grouping similar categories together before encoding, or use dimensionality reduction techniques afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** LabelEncoder assigns numbers based on alphabetical order, which may not match the logical ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Create a custom mapping dictionary to assign numbers in the correct order, or use OrdinalEncoder with specified category orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Missing values in categorical columns cause errors during encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Handle missing values before encoding, either by filling them in or creating a separate category for missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîë Key Points\n",
    "- The choice of encoding technique depends on the nature of the categorical variable and its relationship to the target variable\n",
    "- One-Hot Encoding preserves the lack of order in nominal variables but increases dimensionality\n",
    "- Label Encoding is efficient for ordinal variables but can mislead models with non-ordinal data\n",
    "- Proper encoding is essential for machine learning models to effectively use categorical information\n"
