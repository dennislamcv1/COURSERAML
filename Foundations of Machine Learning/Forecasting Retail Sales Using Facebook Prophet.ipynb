    "## üìã Overview\n",
    "In this lab, you'll apply Facebook Prophet to forecast retail sales data, a crucial task for businesses optimizing inventory and marketing strategies. You'll prepare time series data, build and configure a Prophet model with appropriate seasonality settings, generate forecasts for future periods, and evaluate the model's performance. By the end, you'll have a complete sales forecasting pipeline that provides actionable business insights.\n",
    "## üéØ Learning Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepare time series data specifically for Prophet's required format\n",
    "- Configure and train a Prophet model with appropriate seasonality settings\n",
    "- Generate and visualize sales forecasts including confidence intervals\n",
    "- Interpret forecast components (trend, seasonality, holidays) for business insights\n",
    "- Evaluate forecast performance using appropriate metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Starting Point\n",
    "Access the starter code by running the cells below. The lab uses a retail dataset containing historical sales information that we'll use for forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required tools/setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- pandas, numpy, matplotlib\n",

    "## üîç Common Issues & Solutions\n",
    "**Problem:** Prophet installation fails\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use `!pip install prophet` or try the conda installation `conda install -c conda-forge prophet`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** \"No module named 'prophet'\" error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Some environments require importing as `from fbprophet import Prophet` instead of `from prophet import Prophet`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Model performance is poor with high error metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Try adjusting seasonality parameters, add additional regressors, or experiment with different changepoint settings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Strange seasonal patterns in the forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Check if `seasonality_mode` is set appropriately ('additive' vs 'multiplicative') based on your data patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîë Key Points\n",
    "- Prophet works best when data is properly prepared with clear date and target value columns\n",
    "- Including relevant holidays and seasonal patterns significantly improves retail forecasting accuracy\n",
    "- Component plots help explain the forecasts to business stakeholders by breaking down trends and seasonality\n",
    "- Error metrics provide an objective measure of forecast reliability\n",
    "- Forecasting enables proactive business decisions for inventory management and resource allocation"
