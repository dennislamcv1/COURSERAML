## Coursera Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, PyTorch &amp; Hugging Face Professional Certificate

Professional Certificate - 5 course series

Build and deploy real-world machine learning solutions with confidence. The  Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, PyTorch & Hugging Face Professional Certificate is a hands-on program that teaches through practical, project-based learning using industry tools like Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and LangChain. 

Progress through the full machine learning lifecycleâ€”learning to build, evaluate, and deploy models across diverse applications. Develop models using supervised and unsupervised learning, enhance performance with feature engineering and ensemble methods, and explore reinforcement learning. Work with time series forecasting, modern NLP techniques, tokenization, and embeddings, advancing into deep learning with neural networks and PyTorch. Explore generative AI, covering large language models (LLMs), transformer architectures, and diffusion models. 

Apply skills in hands-on labs, guided projects, and a final capstone to solve a real-world machine learning problem, build and deploy a solution, and implement model monitoring. 

Upon completion, have a portfolio of applied projects that demonstrate your ability to build and deploy machine learning solutions using industry tools. Be equipped to solve real-world data challenges, applying techniques from classical machine learning to deep learning and generative AI. With hands-on experience across the full ML lifecycle, be prepared to contribute to data-driven innovation across a wide range of industries.
